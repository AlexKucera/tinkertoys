# Folder Comparison (comparefolders.sh)

Compare two directories for file differences with detailed reporting and automated output generation.

## Overview

The `comparefolders.sh` script performs comprehensive recursive comparison between two directories, identifying differences in files and generating detailed reports. It's designed for backup verification, synchronization validation, and content auditing.

## Usage

```bash
comparefolders.sh <path1> <path2>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `path1` | Required | Path to first directory to compare |
| `path2` | Required | Path to second directory to compare |

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message and exit |

## Examples

### Basic Directory Comparison
```bash
# Compare two backup directories
./comparefolders.sh /Users/alex/Documents/backup1 /Users/alex/Documents/backup2

# Compare project versions
./comparefolders.sh ~/Projects/v1.0 ~/Projects/v2.0
```

### Backup Verification
```bash
# Verify backup integrity
./comparefolders.sh /original/data /backup/location

# Compare local vs network storage
./comparefolders.sh ~/Documents /Volumes/NetworkDrive/Documents
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Compare development branches (if using file-based projects)
./comparefolders.sh ~/Projects/main-branch ~/Projects/feature-branch

# Verify deployment
./comparefolders.sh ~/local-build ~/staging-deployment
```

## Features

### 🔍 Comprehensive Comparison
- **Recursive Analysis**: Compares all files in subdirectories
- **File Content Comparison**: Detects differences in file contents, not just names
- **Metadata Awareness**: Identifies files with different timestamps or sizes
- **Missing File Detection**: Reports files present in one directory but not the other

### 🛡️ Smart Filtering
- **System File Exclusion**: Automatically excludes `.DS_Store` files
- **Thumbnail Filtering**: Ignores `Thumbs` files for cleaner results
- **Hidden File Handling**: Processes hidden files but filters out system artifacts

### 📊 Detailed Reporting
- **Output File Generation**: Creates `~/compare.txt` with detailed results
- **Difference Counting**: Reports total number of differences found
- **Clear Status Messages**: Provides immediate feedback on comparison results
- **Success Indicators**: Clear indication when directories are identical

## How It Works

The script uses the `diff` command with recursive comparison:

1. **Input Validation**: Verifies both directories exist and are accessible
2. **Recursive Comparison**: Uses `diff -qr` for comprehensive file comparison
3. **Smart Filtering**: Excludes system files that shouldn't affect comparison
4. **Result Processing**: Generates report file and provides summary statistics
5. **Status Reporting**: Clear feedback on comparison results

## Output Format

### Console Output
```bash
Comparing directories...
Path 1: /Users/alex/Documents/old
Path 2: /Users/alex/Documents/new
Output: /Users/alex/compare.txt
✓ Differences found and written to /Users/alex/compare.txt
Number of differences: 5
```

### Report File Format
The generated `~/compare.txt` contains detailed difference information:
```
Only in /path1: unique_file.txt
Only in /path2: new_file.txt
Files /path1/modified.txt and /path2/modified.txt differ
```

## Configuration

### Output Location
- **Default**: Results saved to `~/compare.txt`
- **Automatic**: Output file location reported in console
- **Overwrite**: Each run overwrites previous comparison results

### Environment Variables
No environment variables required. All configuration through command-line arguments.

## Integration

### With Backup Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup verification script
BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
./comparefolders.sh ~/Documents ~/Backups/$BACKUP_DATE

if [[ -s ~/compare.txt ]]; then
    echo "Backup verification failed - differences found"
    exit 1
else
    echo "Backup verification successful"
fi
```

### With Deployment Workflows
```bash
# Pre-deployment verification
./comparefolders.sh ~/build ~/staging
if [[ ! -s ~/compare.txt ]]; then
    echo "Staging matches build - safe to deploy"
else
    echo "Staging differences detected - review required"
    cat ~/compare.txt
fi
```

### Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Daily sync verification
#!/bin/bash
LOG_FILE="/var/log/sync_verification.log"
./comparefolders.sh /local/data /remote/sync

if [[ -s ~/compare.txt ]]; then
    echo "$(date): Sync differences detected" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    cat ~/compare.txt >> "$LOG_FILE"
else
    echo "$(date): Sync verification passed" >> "$LOG_FILE"
fi
```

## Best Practices

### Directory Preparation
1. **Clean Paths**: Ensure directory paths don't contain special characters
2. **Proper Permissions**: Verify read access to both directories
3. **Network Considerations**: Allow extra time for network-mounted directories
4. **Large Directories**: Be patient with very large directory trees

### Result Interpretation
1. **Review Output File**: Always check the generated comparison file
2. **Understand Differences**: Distinguish between content and metadata differences
3. **Filter Expectations**: Remember that system files are automatically filtered
4. **Context Matters**: Consider whether detected differences are expected

### Performance Optimization
1. **Local Comparisons**: Faster when both directories are local
2. **Network Mounts**: Mount network drives before comparison for better performance
3. **Large Files**: Comparison time increases with file count and size
4. **Parallel Runs**: Avoid running multiple comparisons simultaneously

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **Missing Directories**: Clear error message if either directory doesn't exist
- **Permission Issues**: Graceful handling of inaccessible files
- **Network Timeouts**: Proper error reporting for network-related issues
- **Disk Space**: Verification that output file can be written

### Exit Codes
- **0**: Successful comparison (regardless of whether differences found)
- **1**: Error in execution (missing directories, permission issues, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### No Output File Generated
- Check write permissions to home directory
- Verify both input directories exist
- Ensure sufficient disk space for output file

### Missing Differences
- System files (.DS_Store, Thumbs) are intentionally filtered
- Hidden files may not be compared depending on directory permissions
- Symbolic links handled differently than regular files

### Performance Issues
- Large directory trees take significant time
- Network mounted directories slower than local
- Consider using `nice` command for large comparisons

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **diff**: Standard Unix diff command with recursive support
- **grep**: For filtering unwanted files from results
- **Shared Libraries**: Uses common.sh for directory validation

### Filtering Logic
```bash
diff -qr "$path1" "$path2" | grep -v -e 'DS_Store' -e 'Thumbs'
```

### Security Considerations
- **Path Validation**: All paths validated before use
- **No Arbitrary Execution**: No dynamic command execution
- **Safe File Operations**: Read-only operations on input directories
