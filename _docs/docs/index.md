# Tinkertoys Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Tinkertoys utility scripts collection. This repository contains a carefully curated set of automation tools, development utilities, and system administration scripts designed to streamline workflows and improve productivity.

## Overview

Tinkertoys is a collection of utility scripts and automation tools organized by programming language and purpose. The repository includes:

- **Bash Scripts**: System administration, media processing, development tools, and rendering automation
- **Python Scripts**: File management, data processing, and integration utilities  
- **Ruby Scripts**: Task management and workflow integration tools
- **Configuration Files**: Centralized settings for various tools and services

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS**: Most scripts are designed for macOS (some may work on Linux)
- **Bash 4.0+**: Modern bash shell for script execution
- **FFmpeg**: Required for media processing scripts
- **Python 3.6+**: For Python utilities
- **Ruby 2.6+**: For Ruby scripts

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Set up configuration files in the `config/` directory
3. Install required dependencies based on the scripts you plan to use
4. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x script_name.sh`

- **Path Safety**: Protection against path traversal attacks

### Code Organization
- **Modular Design**: Scripts organized by functional category
- **Shared Libraries**: Common functionality extracted to reusable modules
- **Consistent Interface**: Standardized help system across all scripts
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration files

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test suite for all scripts
- **Syntax Validation**: All scripts validated for proper bash syntax
- **Functionality Testing**: Safe functional testing of key operations
- **Integration Testing**: Validation of shared library integration

## Getting Help

Each script includes comprehensive help documentation accessible via:

```bash
script_name.sh --help
