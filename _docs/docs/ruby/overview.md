# Ruby Scripts Overview

Ruby utilities for task management and workflow integration, primarily focused on productivity tool automation.

## Available Scripts

### Task Management Integration
- **merge_asana_into_omnifocus.rb** - Synchronize tasks between Asana and OmniFocus

## Architecture

The Ruby scripts are designed for integration between productivity and project management tools, providing automation for workflows that span multiple applications.

## Requirements

- **Ruby 2.6+** - Modern Ruby interpreter
- **Third-party gems** - Scripts may require specific Ruby gems for API integration
- **Application access** - Some scripts require access to specific applications (OmniFocus, Asana)

## Usage

Ruby scripts are typically run directly:
```bash
ruby script_name.rb [arguments]
```

## Integration

Ruby scripts often serve as bridges between different productivity tools, automating data synchronization and workflow management tasks.
